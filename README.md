"Exploring Weather Trends"
In this project I will analyze local and global temperature data
and compare the temperature trends in SA, Riyadh to overall
global temperature trends.
Tools:
- SQL statements: to extract the data from the database.
- MS Excel: to calculate moving average over decades of years.
